## Privacy Policy (Template) — Send&

Last updated: 02/02/2026

### Summary
Send& helps you send emails in Gmail and schedule follow-ups/reminders. It requires Google OAuth access to your Gmail account to detect replies and send scheduled messages.

### Data we collect
- **Google account email address**: used to associate your Send& account and jobs.
- **Google OAuth tokens** (including a refresh token): used to access Gmail on your behalf to send follow-ups/reminders and check for replies.
- **Scheduled job data**:
  - recipient email addresses (To/Cc),
  - subject line,
  - follow-up/reminder message content you type into Send&,
  - timestamps (when you sent the original email and when the job should run),
  - the Gmail thread/message identifiers needed to reply in-thread.

### How we use data
- **Provide the service**: schedule and send follow-up/reminder emails, and cancel follow-ups if a reply is detected.
- **Security and abuse prevention**: validate requests using your API key and standard server logging.

### Data sharing
- We do **not** sell your personal data.
- Data is shared only with:
  - **Google** (Gmail API) to perform the actions you request,
  - **Infrastructure providers** (hosting/database) required to run the service.

### Data retention
- OAuth tokens and scheduled jobs are stored until you disconnect or delete your account, or until you delete/cancel the jobs.
- Server logs may retain limited metadata for troubleshooting and security for a limited period.

### Your choices
- You can cancel scheduled jobs from the Send& Settings panel.
- You can revoke Send& access at any time from your Google Account security settings.

### Security
- We store tokens server-side and use HTTPS in production.
- Access to the backend is protected with an API key tied to your account.
